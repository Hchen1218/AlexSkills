# Douyin Focus Shuttle

Use only when the user explicitly asks to wait in Douyin during an agent task.

When sending the user away:

```bash
python3 scripts/douyin_focus.py away
```

Before any user-visible question, blocker report, or final answer:

```bash
python3 scripts/douyin_focus.py back
```

Resolve `scripts/douyin_focus.py` relative to this skill folder; use an absolute path if working elsewhere.

Rules: do not scroll, like, follow, log in, scrape, or operate the Douyin account. If automation fails, say it failed and ask the user to manually return to the agent window.
